# E-commerce Test Automation Framework

## Overview
This repository contains an **E-commerce Test Automation Framework** built using **Selenium**, **Cypress**, and **JMeter** to test Amazon's website (or any e-commerce website). The framework includes various types of tests such as functional testing, load testing, and API testing.

## Technologies Used
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation to test the UI (Login, Search, Cart, Checkout).
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing and UI automation.
- **JMeter**: For load and performance testing to simulate user traffic and evaluate system performance.
- **JavaScript (Node.js)**: For scripting and test execution.

## Test Types
1. **Selenium Tests**: 
   - Login functionality.
   - Product search functionality.
   - Cart and checkout functionality.
   
2. **Cypress Tests**: 
   - Similar end-to-end testing with Cypress for quicker feedback during development.
   
3. **API Tests**:
   - Testing APIs related to products and users.
   
4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Load testing using **JMeter** to simulate traffic on Amazon's website.
